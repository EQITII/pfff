COMPILATION:
	In order to compile the software you need CMake (http://www.cmake.org/) as well as
    the usual GCC toolchain. The compilatin process is simple:
    
    > mkdir build
    > cd build
    > cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
    > make
    > make test
    > make package
    
    For Windows, we suggest using Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com).
    Although CMake can be used to create build project for nearly any contemporary build system,
    to the best of our knowledge, currently the code will not compile using Visual Studio compiler.
    It does compile using MinGW, but fails the tests, which means that although the tool is probably
    fully usable, it will not provide the same hashes as on other platforms.
